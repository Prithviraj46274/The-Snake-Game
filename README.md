# The-Snake-Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the player’s score increases.
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body.
This project is implemented using Python and the Turtle Graphics module, making it easy to understand and suitable for beginners learning object-oriented programming and game logic.
